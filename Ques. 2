Write a C program to print the following series:
10, 22, 46, 94, 190, ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int term = 10, diff = 12;  // First term and first difference
    printf("%d, ", term);

    for (int i = 1; i < 5; i++) {  // Print 5 terms
        term = term + diff;
        printf("%d, ", term);
        diff *= 2;  // Double the difference each time
    }

    return 0;
}


OUTPUT:-
10, 22, 46, 94, 190,
